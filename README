Welcome to OfflineQA! This framework was developed by Brant Rumberger
for the 2022 NA61 Krypton Calibration data taking campaign. It was
built using tools and contributions from many NA61 students and
collaborators.

This QA framework runs an instance of SHINE Offline on every chunk of
data that is sent to CTA. The Module Sequence and configuration files
used are located in the directory
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/SHINEReconstruction-master_slc7/

The module sequence contained here only performs TPC cluster
reconstruction and cluster information exporting. Before Krypton
calibration is performed, no pad-by-pad gains should be applied to the
TPCs during cluster reconstruction. This option can be found in
TPCClusterFinderAL.xml in the Module Sequence directory. 

The pad gain calculator program can be found at
shine_src/Applications/Examples/Calibration/TPCKrCalibrationBR/.  The
calculator program should be run on the output of TPCKrCalibrationMN.

Once the pad gains have been calculated, the bootstrap.xml.in file in
the Module sequence directory should point to the new pad gain XML
file, and the pad-by-pad gain correction option should be enabled in TPCClusterFinderAL.

Running of this Module Sequence can be done locally by executing the
script
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/SHINEReconstruction-master_slc7/CopyFromCTAAndRunSHINE.sh -i [inputFile.pteraw] -d [Full directory path (CTA, EOS, etc)] 

If running in this local mode, the output ROOT files will appear in
the ~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/SHINEReconstruction-master_slc7/ directory.

This Module Sequence can be sent to run as an HTCondor job by running the script
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/scripts/SubmitQAJob.sh [inputFile.pteraw] [Full directory path (CTA, EOS, etc)] 

The output will appear instead in the direcrory
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/EOSDropDirectory/. The SHINE logs will appear
in the directory ~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/log.bz2/. The HTCondor logs
will appear in the directory
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/work/[JobSubmissionTime].

To clean the logs, call the command
~/2022-KrCalibration-OfflineQA/scripts/CleanLogs.sh.

NOTE: Don't leave large files from tests in the
.../SHINEReconstruction-master_slc7/ directory. These will be copied
with _every_ job submitted to the .../work/ directory, and this will
fill up the home directory (which has a 10 GB quota! FIXME!).

Have fun!!
